# DelocalizationCriteria
Python module to compute transport phase diagrams. 

The main file encapsulates the core functions to calculate energies and scattering rates of 
cavity polaritons (in the mean-field limit). The Ioffe-Regel criteria for the wave delocalization is applied to obtain the boundaries of polariton states,
with detailed methodology given in _Journal of Chemical Physics_, 159, 034701, 2023.

How to use the functions to generate boundary points and phase 
diagrams is depicted in the notebook Sample.ipynb.

A graphical user interface is provided to display outputs and 
plots of dispersion and phase diagrams.
