# DelocalizationCriteria
Python module to compute transport phase diagrams. 

Main file encapsulates the core functions to calculate energies and scattering rates of 
cavity polaritons. Ioffe-Regel criteria for the wave delocalization is applied delocalization boundaries of polariton states.
Detailed methodology can be found in arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.05474. 

How to use the functions to generate boundary points and phase 
diagrams is depicted in the notebook of Sample.ipynb.

A graphical user interface is provided to display outputs and 
plots of dispersion and phase diagrams.
